# GUIs for slipshow

WIP.

This repository contains experiments for [slipshow](https://github.com/panglesd/slipshow)'s GUI. Mainly targeted for windows users (where `slipshow --serve` is not supported), and users uncomfortable with the command line.

Currently, it hosts the [sliphub's website](https://sliphub.choum.net) (with a collaborative editing editor), as well as a [tauri](https://tauri.dev) GUI for local editing of files. See the releases page to try it!

Next experiment: a VSCode extension.
